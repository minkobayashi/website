## Observations to explore the Universe 

I conduct observations and observational data analysis to investigate the assembly of stars and galaxies.
The science details can be found in the following pages.


## Dark matter distribution in the universe

Keyword: gravitational lensing, dark matter halos, stellar potential, stellar initial mass functions


## Galaxy-galaxy weak lensing 

Keyword: velocity, metallicity

HI gas compression occurs across the Universe.


## Molecular cloud hunting 

Keyword: Carbon Monoxide (CO) lines
