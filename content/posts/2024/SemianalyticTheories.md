## Semi-analytic theories to obtain the long-term evolution of the Universe and establish an unified theory

While numerical simulations investigate the details of individual objects, 
it is important to predict/explain the overall statistics to derive an unified paradigme for long-term evolution of the Universe.
Observations are also snapshots.
