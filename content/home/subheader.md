I am Dr. Masato Kobayashi, a JSPS postdoctoral fellow from University of Cologne, Germany.
I am an astrophysicist investigating **"star formation"** across space and time in the Universe, including the origin of our Solar system. 

I try to reveal the lifecycle of **"molecular clouds"**. Molecular clouds are the formation site of stars and thus they control the star formation history.
I conduct supercomputer simulations, semi-analytic theories, and observations to answer these questions, with many international collaborative projects.
