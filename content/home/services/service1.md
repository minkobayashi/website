Supercomputer simulations are powerful tools to investigate what happened in the past in the Universe and what is happening at far distance in the Universe.

Astronomical phenomena typically have timescales and spatial scales much longer/lager than human lifetime/size
and thus it is important to numerically investigate temporal and spatial evolution of astronomical objects,
with which we can interpret observational results and predict what observations will find.

I have been conducting magnetohydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation process of stars.
I utilize Cray XC30 and XC50 from National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, and RAMSES, CHEOPS, and Odin from University of Cologne.
