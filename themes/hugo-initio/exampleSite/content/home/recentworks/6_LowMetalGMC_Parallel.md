title = "Low-metallicity molecular cloud formation"
+++

Metals in the Universe is key material to form planets as well as important coolant in the interstellar medium to form stars.
Stars form metals by nuclear fusion and eject them through winds and supernova explosions,
which enrich metals in the interstellar medium with time.
Therefore, to understand star formation history in the Universe, it is essential to reveal the formation conditions of molecular clouds,
their properties, and star formation efficiency in a lower metallicity environment, which corresponds to the past of the Universe.

I performed a series of colliding HI flow simulation in a low metallicity environment, which has lower cooling efficiency 
and is expected to inefficiently form molecular clouds. My simulations reveal that 
molecular clouds are born with similar properties down to 0.1 Solar metallicity, 
but their formation timescale is longer almost linearly inverse with metallicity.
